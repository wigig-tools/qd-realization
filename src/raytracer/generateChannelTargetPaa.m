function chOut = generateChannelTargetPaa(chIn,chInRev, infoPAA, trgtFriisFactor)
%GENERATECHANNELTARGETPAA returns the QD channel for each PAA_TX - PAA_RX
%combination.
%
%   [CH_OUT]  =  GENERATECHANNELTARGETPAA(ch_in, info)
%   **ch_in is the diagonal NxN cell array where N is the number of nodes.
%   Each cell includes structs with fields:
%      - channel between PAAs.
%      - rotation informations
%   **info is the supporting structure with PAAs information and indices
%   generated in cluster_paa.
%
%   CH_OUT is the diagonal NxN cell array where N is the number of nodes.
%   The (i,j) cell includes the Nray x Nprop x (PAA_TX x PAA_RX) matrix
%   relative to the i_th TX node and j_th RX node. Nray is the number of
%   rays generated in the QD, Nprop is the number of properties and
%   PAA_TX x PAA_RX is the number of channel connecting the i_th TX node
%   and j_th RX node

% Function which generates a random number using laplace distribution

function x = randomLaplaceGenerator()

% function: x  = randomLaplaceGenerator(m, n)
% m - number of matrix rows
% n - number of matrix columns
% x - matrix with Laplacian distributed numbers with mu = 0 and sigma = 1

% generation of a numbers with Uniform distribution
u=rand;

if u<0.5
    sign=-1;
else
    sign=1;
end

% generation of a numbers with Laplace distribution
x = sign*randomExponetialGenerator(1);

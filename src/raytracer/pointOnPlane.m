function pointOnPlane = pointOnPlane(point, plane)
% pointOnPlane calculates the projection of a point on to plane, by
% constructing a vector passing through the point along plane's normal

% Inputs: point(parameter) which has to be projected on to 
%         a given plane (parameter)
% Ouput: pointOnPlane is array which contains the point projected on plane
